            " Example of text:  It is possible to become a VFX artist without a college degree, but the path is often easier with one. VFX artists usually major in fine arts, computer graphics, or animation. Choose a college with a reputation for strength in these areas and a reputation for good job placement for graduates. The availability of internships is another factor to consider.Out of the jobs advertised for VFX artists, a majority at any given time specify a bachelor’s degree as a minimum requirement for applicants.;\n",
            ", Some studios offer short-term programs for people who want to learn more about VFX artistry without pursuing a college degree. Enrolling in these programs can be expensive as financial aid isn’t always offered, but they usually have the most cutting edge technology for you to learn from., Although you may create some hand sketches, the majority of your work will be completed on the computer using the most up-to-date programs. Stay informed about the newest software advances by following VFX blogs and taking online computer tutorials.For example, VFX artists are expected to be well-versed in graphics and animation programs, such as Adobe Creative Suite and JavaScript.Clearly list every program that you can work with on your resume.\n",
            " Hop onto YouTube or another video service and search for VFX clip reels or demonstrations. Some of these videos will focus on a particular skill set, such as shading, which you then can practice on your own. Challenge yourself to mimic some of the more difficult tasks, or even try to improve upon the models used., Take as many art and design classes as you can. Or, simply carry a sketch pad around with you to work on your basic animation skills. As you draw, consider factors such as lighting and framing. Even geometry skills can come in handy when creating a particular type of background or even a person’s face.Make a choice to become an observer of the world around you. Ask yourself: how could I capture the movement of the leaves? Or, in what situations do shadows appear?\n",
            "\n",
            ", Watch all of these creations with an eye for detail. Look for the techniques used and any original approaches that you see. Try to recreate any scenes that you find particularly interesting. Research the artists and see what their backgrounds are and contact them if you like., As you gain more experience, you’ll likely find yourself gravitating toward a certain aspect of design. This will become your “calling card” and directors and other professionals will seek you out for this type of work. To build your specialization, start choosing jobs with that emphasis and attend additional training seminars.For example, some VFX specialists focus on human character’s faces, animal figures, or city backgrounds.\n"

Some reputable manufacturers of duck food are Purina, Mazuri, or Gunter.Though chicken feed can be substituted for duck food, chicken feed should not be fed to ducklings.Once the ducklings reach 20 weeks of age, you can substitute duck food for chicken feed with the same amount of protein.;, Male and female ducks will both need the same amount of protein. Check the back of your duck food bag for nutritional information. You can begin to feed the female ducks this higher protein diet in the spring time, when they are likely to begin laying eggs. These treats should compromise no more than 15-20% of a duck’s diet. Cut all treats into small pieces. You can also let your duck graze outside, provided the area they are grazing has no pesticides or other toxic materials.Don’t season or cook these treats. Feed them raw.Bread, chocolate, onion, garlic, popcorn, avocados, and citrus fruits should not be fed to ducks. Remove the food at night so it does not begin to rot or attract ants and rats. Each duck will consume about 6-7 ounces of food per day, but bigger ducks may eat a bit more. Buying duck food in bulk will work for feeding large flocks, but for smaller flocks, buy small amounts of food frequently so they will have fresh food all the time. Moldy food can make ducks very sick.Store leftover duck food where it can keep dry. This water can be provided in a trough, an outdoor pond, or a shallow bucket. Any large, open container the ducks can fit their bill in will suffice. If you decide to use a watering system, such as those designed for chickens or turkeys, just make sure the ducks can reach the water.The water should always be clean, as ducks are especially prone to botulism.Change the water daily. Newborn ducks need to be kept at 86°F (30°C) for the first week and at 81°F (27°C) after that.After 4-6 weeks, ducks can regulate their temperature and no longer</s>\n",
